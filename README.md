# scripts : Miscellaneous Raspberry Pi and Arduino scripts

* **pin_check.py**:  displays a continually-updating console display showing the status of a Raspberry Pi 3 B+'s pins.
* **pink_led.py**:   grabs a snapshot of a 640x480 Raspberry Pi camera and compares the 'color distance' between each pixel and a fixed color, displaying the result to the console.
* **scanip**:        scans the local network for IP addresses matching 192.168.1.*
* **findpy**:        a command line search tool that looks for strings within *.py files and provides a colorized report
* **findxml**:       a command line search tool that looks for strings within *.xml files and provides a colorized report
* **api**:           prints the classes, methods and functions of a file in color (requires colorama). Works with Python or MicroPython.

The two find* files are basically Python simplifying wrappers around the unix "find" command, that provide a nice colorised output.
